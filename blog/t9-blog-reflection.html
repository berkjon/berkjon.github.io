          Writing my DBC blogs each week has been an interesting experience.  On the positives, it has spurred me to research and learn about a handful of new topics that weren't part of our core curriculum each week.  It's also been good (although probably insufficient) practice getting back into medium- to long-form writing, which I have fallen woefully out of practice with since college.  Back then I considered it a strength, but six years of writing emails and presentations where bullet points and brevity reign has left me with a serious case of writers block in my blog posts.  Not necessarily writers block in that I can't thing of what I want to say, but rather I can't think of how to articulate it in a way that doesn't sound like a middle schooler crafting a sentence.  So the practice in that regard is appreciated.

          Some aspects have been more trying, though.  Perhaps not surprisingly, I've found it difficult and painful to write about things that I was forced to write about.  Some topics I got to choose, but others were strictly defined, and I found myself reaching for interesting things to say where I had none.  Ultimately much of what I wrote felt forced, or like a regurgitation of things I'd picked up while researching the topic.

          I also felt like I had to short-change the subjects I wrote about due to time constraits.  The guidlines say we shouldn't spend more than about an hour researching and writing our blog posts, but I found I couldn't even research most of the technical posts adequately in that time, let alone explain them.  In almost every case with the technical posts, I was writing about something I knew nothing about an hour earlier, and the plain, superficial analysis I came up with probably reflects that.  Due to time constraints I also spent no time proof reading my posts, which is where I'd typically make all the smaller changes to reconfigure sentences, choose better words, and clarify or consolidate points.
        </p>

          Looking forward, I absolutely want to do more blogging.  That's been true for years -- I have plenty of thoughts and opinions and I've often thought I'd enjoy another outlet for them.  I've just struggled to make time and insert it into my routine.  But I also want to do it on topics I truly care about, where I have genuine insights and opinions to share, and where I can give both the subjects, and my own writing, the time and consideration they deserve.  That is my goal for my future of blogging.
