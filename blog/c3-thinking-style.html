        Several weeks ago I took a <a href="www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" alt="Personal Thinking Style test">Personal Thinking Style</a> test, based on research by Anthony Gregorc, a professor of curriculum and instruction at UConn.  He describes four distinct thinking styles, explained <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" alt="Gregorc Thinking Styles">here</a>, called:
        <ol>
          <li>Concrete Sequential (CS)</li>
          <li>Abstract Random (AR)</li>
          <li>Abstract Sequential (AS)</li>
          <li>Concrete Random (CR)</li>
        </ol>
        My scores were CS: 24; AS: 40; AR: 16; CR: 40.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will say up front that I strongly question the accuracy of tests like these in general, because they have a tendency to over-simplify very complex issues.  Some people argue that's the point, but my sense is that they are just too ambiguous and imprecise to add any value.  In every question, I found myself wanting clarification on what exactly was meant by a word, or torn between choices and eventually forced just to pick at random.  To use question #4 as an example, I really don't know what is meant by "Personal", and "Adventurous" is too vague for me to know how to answer.  I consider myself very adventurous with some things, like sports or travel, and very un-adventurous with other things like food or investing.  I can't remember how I answered this question when I took the test the first time, but I would be surprised if my answer were the same again, as it basically feels like a random choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all that aside, after reading the descriptions of each thinking style, I can absolutely identify elements of each with which I can relate.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the "Concrete Sequential" category, I can identify with liking a logical sequence and getting facts.  I enjoy applying ideas in pragmatic ways, and I would prefer to work in an organized rather than unorganized environment, assuming I understand those terms correctly.  However I also really enjoy working in groups, dealing with abstract ideas, and using my imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        From "Abstract Random", I identify with liking to listen to others, establishing healthy relationships with others (who doesn't?), and focusing on the issues at hand.  I think I am comfortable working with broad or general guidelines as long as the subject matter is not completely new to me, and I like group activities.  However, I would put myself in the opposite camp on almost every item under "What's hard for them?" -- I like competition, love giving exact details, seek criticism, usually focus on one thing at a time, and have no problem with "difficult" personalities who may seem unfriendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          From "Abstract Sequential", I identify strongly with wanting to analyze situations before making a decision, and applying logic in solving problems.  I absolutely learn best when I am in a stimulating work environment and have access to experts or references.  I also feel very comfortable working alone, and depending on the nature of the task, sometimes prefer it.  I also agree with some of the identified difficulties, like dealing with lots of specific rules and regulations, or repeating the same tasks over and over.  However I like to think I'm also diplomatic when convincing others of things, and can operate well under time constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, from "Concrete Random", I identify with experimenting to find answers, solving problems independently, and relying on intuition.  Trial-and-error approaches can definitely help me learn, because they allow me to identify patterns in things, which I use to back into the bigger underlying concept.  I also admit that I do not enjoy re-doing something once it's already done, and (as evidenced by this test), "choosing only one answer" can be difficult depending on the circumstance.  However I would not say that I learn best when competing with others.  Competition absolutely motivates me to train and work harder, but I think I actually learn better in a more collaborative environment.  I also don't think I have any difficulty keeping detailed records, or with following routines.
        </p>
        <p>
        Based on this exercise and my own general attempts at self-awareness and introspection, there are some things I intend to focus on throughout DBC.  One big issue I've identified already is that I am discovering many more things I want to learn than I have available hours in the day.  My Chrome browser is cluttered with dozens of tabs for things I wanted to read in detail but just didn't have time.  My hope is to come back to them when I have spare time, but so far the list just keeps getting longer, and I can't cross things off quickly enough.  I am planning to get more organized, using Evernote and Chrome bookmarks to save all of these things for later, so that they dont' completely fall by the wayside.  Another related issue I have is dealing with distractions.  I enjoy the freedom to follow links that interest me and learn about related topics not necessarily part of our core curriculum.  However this has left me scrambling on Sunday nights to complete mandatory assignments before the submission deadline, so I realize I need to be more disciplined about doing the required work first, and only once it's finished, going back to explore the tangents.  This is a little counter to my preferred learning style, so I know it will be an adjustment.
