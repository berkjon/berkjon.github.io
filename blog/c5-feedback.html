        <p>
          One of the things DBC has really emphasized over the last five weeks is the importance of peer pairing to work through challenges, as well as giving and receiving feedback based on those pairings.  Students are asked to participate in at least two pairings per week, and then submit anonymous feedback on the partner which should be actionable, specific and kind.  I've participated in about a dozen pairing sessions so far, and today's post will cover some of my observations and learnings thus far.
        </p>
        <h3>Pairing</h3>
        <p>
          Pairing on coding challenges has been an interesting learning experience for me.  At first it felt a little awkward, as I was meeting complete strangers for the first time via Google hangout, and had to work through "challenges" that really didn't make sense for two people, like setting up a local Git repository.  We were told to follow a driver/navigator pairing format, but that didn't really make sense for what we were doing the first couple weeks.  Once the coding challenges began in Week 3, however, I started to see the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest factor in peer pairing that people don't seem to talk about much is who you pair with.  In my very limited experience so far, my partners have varied greatly in their abilities -- and not just in technical aptitude but in their communication ability, research skills, thought clarity and overall eagerness to experiment with new ideas or approaches.  That's life, and it's certainly not meant as a complaint or critique.  It's great practice for pairing on the job, I am sure.  But as I reflect on my pairings so far, I have a hard time deciding just how valuable it's been.  On several occasions I learned a tremendous amount in a very short amount of time -- little tricks and things you can't easily get from a book -- and also felt great flow/synergy with my partner.  Neither of us was clearly more advanced than the other, and sometimes we felt outmatched by the challenge, but we bounced around ideas and iterated quickly & frequently until we finally had a working solution.  It was satisfying, and also built some camaraderie.
        </p>
        <p>
          However on some other occasions, the challenge either got the best of us, or one of us was kind of getting dragged along by the other.  At least once while we were stuck on a challenge and I was "driving", I felt hindered by the driver/navigator roles we were supposed to follow.  If I was working alone I would have stopped coding for half an hour to better educate myself on the particular topic, but while pairing I felt like this could be disrespectful to my partner.  I didn't want to snatch away his/her role, nor did I want to waste his/her time in a hangout while I re-read a chapter from a textbook.  Ultimately we slogged through an hour+ making very minimal progress, before agreeing it would be best to wrestle with it independently for a while.  It took me a few more hours, but I eventually solved the challenge solo and we shared notes.  I think in "real life" there would be a handful of good ways to help avoid such situations or change/abort them more quickly, but for now it seems like it's all just part of the learning experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Much like pairing, I've found feedback in DBC to be a bit of a mixed bag, except without the real downside of spending hours running down a dead end.  Some feedback has been eye opening, some just affirming, and some rather hollow or lacking substance.  But the thoughtful feedback has already been priceless.  It's the kind of stuff a new acquaintance wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable sharing directly, but was probably thinking the entire time we were working together without me even realizing it.  And having the feedback loop formalized like this -- where feedback is required at the end of every pairing, and asked to follow a host of best practices -- saves me the chore of actively soliciting feedback from peers, who might only feel comfortable delivering the good feedback to me anyway.  Anonymity is really critical to ensuring you get honest feedback -- there are just too many social disincentives to being constructively critical of someone otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the most important piece of constructive feedback I've received is that I need to be more mindful of whether my partner is following along with what I'm doing or not.  It's so easy for the driver, in particular, to charge on ahead when s/he has an idea of something they want to try.  But if you're moving too quickly for the navigator to follow, or not pausing to explain your thought process well enough, then you're just shoving them to the sidelines and probably destroying any chance of learning something from them in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the flip side, I've received some consistent feedback that people really liked how vocal I was in offering up new ideas or approaches we could try, and seemed eager to experiment with new things.  That was helpful to hear, as I had some concerns as to whether I was being too aggressive in advocating a particular approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, with respect to writing feedback for others, I've found it a bit of a chore but becoming progressively easier as I am able to get more specific about what worked well and what could be improved.  Sometimes the ideas just flow, and I can share all the things I would want to know if I were in their shoes.  Other times it's harder to think of something really worthwhile to share, but I've noticed as my vocabulary in this area grows, so too does the specificity of my feedback.
