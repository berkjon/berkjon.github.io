          Over the last 9 weeks of DBC prep I've had an awful lot of questions, and seen many more asked by others across the web.  So what makes a good question?  As with many things in life, the Golden Rule serves as an excellent guide.  It is helpful to think about how the person being asked the question would understand your question.  What is their background/context?  What is implicit in the question and what needs to be clarified?  And how might your question be misinterpreted?
        </p>
        <p>
          When structuring questions, I try to be as specific as possible to avoid any ambiguity.  If there's any chance for confusion when I say "their" or "she" or "it", I repeat the proper noun even if it feels repetitive.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Don't Assume Anything.  Even if you think something is probably a given, like what language you're talking about or an approach you've already tried, just say it explicitly so there is no doubt.</li>
          <li>Be Concise.  People are busy, so you need to be efficient in asking your question.  Don't cut corners, but don't be overly verbose either. </li>
          <li>Simplify.  Where possible, try to reduce the question down to its core.  Eliminate other variables that aren't relevant but might distract from your question. </li>
          <li>Stay Focused.  Drill in one one specific question and try to resolve that before moving on to others.  Don't waste time mentioning things that aren't directly relevant. </li>
          <li>Be Specific.  Include lots of details, even if you're not sure that they're relevant.  </li>
          <li>Provide background.  How did you arrive at this question?  Did it stem from something else you were working on?  The more context you give up front, the better chances someone will be able to help you.  This is especially important if there's a chance you aren't even asking the exact right question. </li>
          <li>Help others recreate the issue.  Provide the exact input you are using, so others can try it.  If appropriate, also define the output you are trying to achieve.</li>
          <li>Favor using proper nouns over "their" or "she" or "it" if there is any chance for ambiguity in the context of your sentence.  It might be repetitive but it's better than being unclear. </li>
          <li>Use proper spelling, punctuation and grammar.  It can avoid areas of confusion or ambiguity, and generally make you sound more credible. </li>
          <li>Make others want to help you.  Be polite, be friendly, be eager.  Say thank you.  </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To illustrate the point, here are a few examples of bad subject lines for questions posted to an online community:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Trouble with looping" could be rewritten "Why does my for loop create a stack overflow issue?</li>
          <li>"Can't format correctly" could be rewritten "Trouble positioning nav bar above header using CSS"</li>
          <li>"Mac screenshot question" could be rewritten "How do I screenshot a portion of my screen on a Mac?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ... and so on -- you get the idea.  I try to follow these principles wherever I go, will be sure to carry them into DBC with me.
