        <p>
          This week we were asked to write about a conflict in our lives, and answer a number of questions about it.
        </p>
        <h3>Discuss a time you had a conflict.  What was it about?  What happened?</h3>
        <p>
          Since DBC prep has started and I've needed to add another 25-30 hours of work a week to my usual routine, I've had to make some tough choices about what to cut back on to make space.  Social functions took a big hit, as has my workout routine, but the one that's caused the most conflict is less time with loved ones.  It's a lingering issue, but for purposes of this post, I'll try to focus on one particular conflict where a loved one was disappointed I had to cancel (at the last minute) plans we had made.
        </p>
        <h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
        <p>
          The source of conflict was the fact that I needed to get work done, both for DBC and my regular job, and it meant I had to cancel preexisting plans to do it.  This hurt and disappointed my loved one.
        </p>
        <h3>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h3>
        <p>
          I felt frustrated, and like I was getting pinched on both ends.  I was also looking forward to the plans we'd made, and was equally sad and disappointed that I had to cancel them to work.  But getting into an argument about it also made me feel like my pursuit to do DBC was not really being supported by my loved one.
        </p>
        <h3>What actions did you take to resolve the conflict?</h3>
        <p>
          I gave a lot of detail about what I was working on, so it didn't seem like this mysterious thing to her.  I tried to be specific about when I WOULD be free, without overcommitting myself.  I communicated that her disappointment in me left me feeling unsupported.  And I apologized for not being able to make our plans, but probably not enough.
        </p>
        <h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
        <p>
          I would have apologized more, and tried to communicate even earlier that it looked like I might not be able to make the plans we had.
        </p>
        <h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
        <p>
          I think I already expected this to be an issue, so I can't say I learned how tough it would be to manage my time during DBC.  I suppose I learned that the only real solution to 1) just try harder and finish my work on time, and 2) make fewer plans, and under-promise on my availability.
