          Interesting "culture blog" topic assignment by DBC this week -- Stereotype Threat.  I'd never heard this term before, but the concept is very familiar.  <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html" alt="What is stereotype threat?">This site</a> defines it quite well, so I won't waste the space here.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, the most striking thing about stereotype threat is that humans seem so thoroughly aware of it, and yet still struggle with fighting it in their own lives.  From grade school or before, children are taught the importance of believing in themselves, and assured they can do anything if they set their mind to it.  We, as parents and teachers, understand the importance of building up their confidence in these realms, because we were in their shoes once and know how daunting a new subject or skill can feel when you're first getting started.  We have also learned through history and personal experience that greatness can come from any corner, and that (with rare exception), people are not born with material advantage in certain fields over others.

          Meanwhile adults are also aware of the many stereotypes that pervade our society, and I suspect would agree that they are generally grounded in bias and prejudice rather than a deep social/human truth.  Even the ones that are supported by data -- there are far fewer women inventors than men, for example -- are understood to be symptoms of something deeper, and not a direct cause-and-effect relationship.  If I cited the 2012 statistic that <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17888" alt="Why Don't Women Patent?">only 5.5% of US patent holders are female</a> to any friends or colleagues, I am certain nobody would think it is simply because women are bad inventors.  I believe most people understand, at least on some level, the depth and complexity of social and cultural practices that factor into such a statistic.
        </p>

          And that is precisely why stereotype threat is so fascinating.  Because despite "knowing" that most of these stereotypes are complete nonsense, we still have a very difficult time freeing ourselves from their grips.  Human psychology is rife with <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/identifying-irrational-thoughts/000886" alt="Identifying Irrational Thoughts">irrational thoughts and behaviors</a>, and to me this is another classic example of it.  Our minds fall victims to the very same stereotypes we know are untrue, and thereby contribute to a bizarre self-fulfilling prophecy.
        </p>

          Sounds rather depressing.  So what's a human to do?  My personal strategy is to try and view these situations as a special sort of challenge, that is even more rewarding to conquer for the very reason that it defies cultural expectations and norms.  It's a uniquely satisfying feeling, to know someone expects you to do something or act a certain way because of your background or appearance, and then you do the exact opposite.  On the "micro" level, I like that approach because it provides added motivation to do something good, and something where people like me might be underrepresented in, by definition.  And on the "macro" level, I like it even more, because I firmly believe that the only long-term sustainable way to destroy a stereotype is to render it invalid.  Let's have a few decades where women file more patents than men, or make more advancements in theoretical physics, and see just how long those stereotypes hold up.  But of course it's a long road to get there, and along the way there may be certain one-sided policy choices we adopt to accelerate the pace, such as offering gender-based scholarships for women pursuing STEM degrees and the like.  I just hope people don't lose sight of the ultimate goal -- a free-standing society where individuals' ambitions are unconstrained by stereotype threat, and the stereotyped are not dependent on the charity of others or a progressive social policy to reach their full potential.
