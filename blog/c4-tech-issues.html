          In the last 5-10 years, Convertible Notes (aka Convertible Debt) emerged as a popular new financing option for early stage start-ups.  There were a few main factors, real or perceived, driving their adoption:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Avoid price/valuation discussions</li>
        <li>Minimize legal fees and overhead</li>
        <li>Overall simplicity and speed to close</li>
    </div>
    <p>
      The biggest, and most controversial, is probably around pricing.  For the uninitiated, Convertible Note pricing typically has two components:
      <ol>
        <li>A discount percentage on the valuation in the next financing round, typically in the range of 10-30%.  The idea is that, since an earlier investor puts in money at a riskier time for the business, they deserve a significantly lower price than the investors who come in later on.
        <li>A valuation cap, i.e. the maximum price the convertible note holder will acquire equity at in the subsequent round.  So if an investor puts in $1M with a $10M cap, and the company raises additional equity at a $20M pre-money valuation a year later, then the convertible note holder effectively gets equity at a 50% discount to the new investors.  This protects the convertible note investor above and beyond the discount percentage, since a 20% discount to a $20M valuation would still mean the debt investor converts at a price of $16M, rather than the maximum cap of $10M.</li>
      </ol>
      Notes priced on these terms are called <string class="bold">Discounted Convertible Notes with a Cap</string.

      There are a number of problems with convertible notes that can cause unexpected issues both for founders and for investors, unfortunately.  The first one should be the elephant in the room: valuation.  While it is understandable for entrepreneurs and investors to want to avoid this hard conversation at such an early stage -- when there is so little hard evidence on when to make a decision -- it can easily come back to bite them later on.  Much better to have the difficult conversations up front, before you enter a formal business relationship that is likely to last many years, than after.  Furthermore, caps don't actually free entrepreneurs from many of the negatives associated with setting a price.  One of the big issues founders face is with "down rounds", and unfortunately, raising money at a price lower than your valuation cap can often be a red flag to those outside your company, and an unexpected *perceived* dilutive event to existing equity holders.

      There absolutely is merit to giving early investors a discount to subsequent rounds, but it can be achieved through other mechanisms besides discounts and caps.  To offer an investor a 20% discount, you could just issue her one "free" share for every four purchased.  Five for the price of four.  In practice this free share would be structured as a nominally-priced warrant, without any of the preferred stock rights.  But the economic effect is the same.

      Convertible notes also have a perception of being "cheaper" in terms of legal fees, because most of the docs are boiler-plate, and do not require all the legwork of a formal equity round.  However thanks to the smart work of lawyers like Ted Wang, the terms and structure of seed-stage equity rounds are becoming more standardized, and require less customization as well.  Less customization = fewer billable hours, and many seed equity rounds can now be completed for just ~$5k, leveraging a wealth of preexisting documents.

      There are countless other considerations here which I don't have time to address in this post -- quality of the investors, control provisions, effective liquidation preferences, board rights, signaling issues, etc.  But thanks largely to YCombinator and other accelerators, convertible notes are likely here to stay, at least for a while.  It is important for entrepreneurs and investors alike to research their various funding options thoroughly, and understand their key characteristics.
