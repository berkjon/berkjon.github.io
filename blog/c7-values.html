          Following on last week's discussion of Stereotype Threat, this week we were asked to consider our own values, and how they might help us combat it.  From a list of about 100, I narrowed my most cherished down to: Adventure, Compassion, Courage, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Fairness, Freedom, Integrity, Loyalty, Responsibility, and Truth.  Though not on the list of options, I would also add Empathy and Reason to the mix.  Together, these words capture the essence of what drives me and motivates me as a person.  They explain most of the decisions I make, big and small.  I feel them in my thoughts, and try to live up to them in my words and in my actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For purposes of this post, I'm just going to explore two in detail: Courage and Empathy.  These are two of the most foundational values to me, in that some of the others emanate from those in certain respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Courage, I find the motivation to confront fears and face new challenges.  I remind myself that most things worth having do not come easily -- they take hard work and usually involve risk.  Just as it takes courage to stand up for things you believe in, it takes courage to make big changes in your own life, as they will always require work and involve risk.  Comfort and complacency are the vices that threaten courage -- when those things are in abundance, I find it harder to motivate myself to grow in new ways.  It's critical to find courage in those moments.  Courage also underpins other values like Responsibility, because it takes courage to hold yourself accountable and admit the many things for which (and to whom) we are responsible.  Not surprisingly, it is also difficult to find Adventure without first finding Courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Empathy, I find the guide that informs my interactions and supports my connection with other living creatures.  Empathy is the value on which principles like "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" are built.  I believe concepts of Justice and Morality would be largely vacant without empathy.  Similarly for my values of Freedom, Compassion and Loyalty.  Empathy is the value that reminds me to ask myself questions about others -- where are they coming from, what have their life experiences been, what is their context, what are their values?  It also reminds me to put myself in others' shoes before passing judgment on them.  And it extends to animals as well, as far as I'm concerned.  I find great empathy with other living creatures, which in practical terms impacts my eating, buying, and giving behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course these values often influence the advice I give others as well.  Just days ago I discussed with a friend the pros and cons of him leaving his current job to pursue something more entrepreneurial, and the concept of courage was front and center.  Similarly, in discussing year-end charitable giving with my family, I found myself promoting animal rights causes and programs to improve human quality of life in developing countries, because I feel great empathy with those afflicted humans and animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect these values to play an important part in my time at DBC, as they do in most parts of my life.  In combatting Stereotype Threat specifically, I'll seek the courage to keep pushing when things feel overwhelming, and the empathy to remind myself that we are all fighting our own personal struggles, and feeling sorry for myself or trying to benchmark myself against others is a road to nowhere.
