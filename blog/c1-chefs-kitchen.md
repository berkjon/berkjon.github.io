DBC Culture - Week 1 Impressions

November 23, 2014

As one of our final exercises for this week, DBC students are asked to watch a fireside chat video with the company's founder, here (http://vimeo.com/85001014) and share our reactions -- what we think of the culture, how our expectations of the program have changed, etc.

I thought the main points Shereef made in the video are great.  He identifies two common mindsets people have when entering the program
1) "Restaurant", or consumer mindset, wherin students enter the program with fixed expectations for what they want to receive in exchange for their investment.  It is largely transactional, and the high price breeds a sense of entitlement.  When something doesn't meet their expectations, they are disappointed and can mentally disengage from the program.  Needless to say, this can be problematic and is the wrong mindset to have.
2) "Kitchen", or creator mindset, where everyone is working in the back scrambling to make the stew together.  The core concept here is shared ownership of the whole experience.  You get out of the program exactly what you put into it.

I wholeheartedly agree that the creator mindset is the right approach.  To approach learning any new skill with fixed expectations about what others owe you is simply naive.  The best any instructor can do is lay out a good path in front of you; it is always the responsibility of the student to embrace the challenge and commit to doing the actual work.  Learning, more than any other activity I can imagine, embodies the "you get what you put into it" concept.  There's just no way to learn something without taking ownership of your own education.

I also appreciated the Two Opposing Fears that Shareef identified in many students entering the program, which essentially boil down to either 1) imposter syndrome, or 2) arrogance.  While I'm not surprised to hear those are the two most common fears among students, it is very interesting that he often sees the two existing simultaneously within the same student.  I think my takeaway here is to try and check both insecurities and ego at the door, and just focus on the actual material and my own progress from where I am starting.  I enjoy competition, but setting benchmarks against others at this point in my development just seems counterproductive, or at best a waste of time.

I'm interested to see how much I click with some other aspects of DBC, like the mandatory yoga and surrounding culture.  My initial instinct is skepticism, but I'm going to keep an open mind and wait to pass judgment until I try it.  Regardless, it's refreshing to know that the "macro culture" concepts of being a creator, owning your own development, supporting others through theirs, etc., are very much aligned with my own.
